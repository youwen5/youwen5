I'm Youwen. You can visit me at [my website](https://youwen.dev) or [at my
blog](https://blog.youwen.dev).

I care deeply about systems and how we can make them more reliable and
resilient. To that end I contribute to various open source projects that aim
to increase reproducibility and determinism in software systems at scale.

I run a [purely
functional](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Purely_functional_programming)
computing environment that enables the deterministic deployment of software,
configuration, and infrastructure all the way down the stack. This includes
both the [system itself](https://nixos.org), which can never mutate state and
must be rebuilt for modifications to be made, as well as a [purely functional
userspace](https://github.com/nix-community/home-manager), that keeps programs
configured precisely as described and managed transactionally. My [text
editor](https://github.com/youwen5/viminal2) is configured in Fennel Lisp and
deployed in a purely functional fashion by [Nix](https://nixos.org).

Additionally, I prefer to work on and with [software that respects my
freedom](https://www.gnu.org/philosophy/free-sw.en.html). In fact my M1 Macbook
Pro runs an entirely free [reverse engineered graphics and driver
stack](https://asahilinux.org/). All of my computers run an free GNU/Linux
[operating system](https://github.com/youwen5/liminalOS).

Key benefits of my approach to computing include:

- fearless hacking: as the system is rebuilt each time it is modified, it can
  simply transactionally rollback to a previous system generation.
- text-based and keyboard driven: by keeping the system entirely deterministic
  (not just technically, but philosophically), I can ditch unwieldy graphical
  interfaces and build a text-centered user experience.
- trustless full source bootstrap: secure yourself from malevolent state actors
  and resist the [KTH](https://wiki.c2.com/?TheKenThompsonHack) by
  [bootstrapping the entire
  system](https://guix.gnu.org/blog/2023/the-full-source-bootstrap-building-from-source-all-the-way-down/)
  from its free source code and a minimal amount of binary seeds.

In the boring real world I study mathematics in

The main topics covered are the classification of compact 2-manifolds, the fundamental group, covering spaces, singular homology theory, and singular cohomology theory. These topics are developed systematically, avoiding all unecessary definitions, terminology, and technical machinery. Wherever possible, the geometric motivation behind the various concepts is emphasized. </p><p>Which Springer GTM would <i>you</i> be?  <a href="http://math.jhu.edu/~savitt/GTM.html">The Springer GTM Test</a></p></td></tr></table>
