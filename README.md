I'm Youwen. You can visit me at [my website](https://youwen.dev) or
[at my (currently sparse) blog](https://blog.youwen.dev).

I do math and sometimes code in my free time. My primary occupation, of course,
is ricing my sprawling Arch Linux system and Neovim setup. This takes up the
vast majority of my time.

I formerly did web development before I realized that the internet was pure
bloat and so I excised it from my life. Now, I'm a recovering TypeScript addict
recently converted to the Church of Haskell and learning category theory. When
I'm not doing that, I occasionally actually write code.

You may notice that most of my projects are written in Rust or other lesser
languages, and not Haskell. This is because Haskell is far too intellectual to
be used for actual software. Haskell programs exist purely in the
[noÃ¶sphere](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Noosphere) as the real world is not
nearly pure enough. Therefore, Rust is my language of choice for hacking.

I'm also somewhat familiar with C, Python, and Go. These languages are also
suitable for hacking, and together with Rust and Haskell cover the vast majority
of software use cases. However, I seldom create projects with them as they do
not satisfy my desire to derail every programming discussion into a
philosophical one about abstract mathematics.

I'm a staunch supporter of Free Software - that is, software which is Free as in
Freedom and respects the
[four essential freedoms](https://www.gnu.org/philosophy/free-sw.en.html#four-freedoms).
